# Better Step API Overview

The Better Step API is divided into several core modules. Each module provides the functionality required to work with different aspects of CAD data processing.

## Modules Include

- **Geometry:** Classes and methods to represent and manipulate curves and surfaces.
- **Topology:** Structures for organizing relationships between geometric entities (edges, faces, loops, shells, and solids).
- **Sampling:** Functions for extracting point clouds, computing normals, and generating features.
- **Visualization:** Tools to render and inspect CAD models and sampling results.

> Auto-generated API references (using mkdocstrings) are available within each moduleâ€™s documentation.
