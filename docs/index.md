# Better Step: Open‑source CAD Data Conversion & Sampling

Better Step is designed to unlock CAD data for research and industry. By converting proprietary STEP files into an open HDF5-based format, Better Step enables efficient processing on large-scale computing clusters—eliminating the need for expensive proprietary licenses.

## Key Features

- **Open Format:** Proprietary CAD files are converted into a widely accessible HDF5 format.
- **Comprehensive Representation:** Captures both the geometry (curves, surfaces) and topology (solids, shells, faces, loops) of CAD models.
- **Robust Sampling Methods:** Provides reliable methods to compute surface normals, detect sharp features, and generate point clouds for machine learning applications.
- **Extensible API:** Easily integrate the library into Python workflows.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Supports batch processing for streamlined integration in automated pipelines.

## Getting Started

- Visit the [Installation](installation.md) page for setup instructions.
- Check out the [Usage](usage.md) page for practical examples and workflows.

## Learn More

- **API Documentation:** Detailed overviews of modules like Geometry, Topology, Sampling, and Visualization.
- **Examples:** Interactive notebooks and sample code are provided to demonstrate advanced use cases.
- **FAQ & Changelog:** Find answers to common questions and track project updates.
