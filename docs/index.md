# Better Step
## Open‑source CAD Data Conversion & Sampling

Better Step is designed to unlock CAD data for research and industry. By converting proprietary STEP files into an open HDF5-based format, Better Step enables efficient processing on large-scale computing clusters, eliminating the need for expensive proprietary licenses.

## Key Features

- **Open Format:** Proprietary CAD files are converted into a widely accessible HDF5 format.
- **Comprehensive Representation:** Captures both the geometry (curves, surfaces) and topology (solids, shells, faces, loops) of CAD models.
- **Robust Sampling Methods:** Provides reliable methods to compute surface normals, detect sharp features, and generate point clouds for machine learning applications.
- **Extensible API:** Easily integrate the library into Python workflows.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Supports batch processing for streamlined integration in automated pipelines.
